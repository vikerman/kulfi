# Kulfi

A performance focused Web SDK.

## Introduction

Aspirational ideas:

### Runtime

- Prerender by default (Configurable SSR/SSG)
- Filesystem based routing
- Component level code splitting (download only used JS)
- Progressive Hydration (Execute JS only when needed)

### Tooling

- Fast no-bundler dev mode 
- Static checks for performance patterns/anti-patterns
- Use budgets for everything - JS, HTML, CSS
- Integrate with performance tools in CI to catch regressions
- Setup real world client metrics
